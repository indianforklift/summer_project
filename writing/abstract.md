One of the fundamental distinctions between life and non-life lies in biology’s remarkable capacity to harness, store, transmit, and even replicate information.
In this project, I aim to get at the nature of information flow in simple biochemical signalling systems using tools from communication and information theory.
Specifically, I will simulate a minimal signalling cascade consisting of an input (ligand concentration),
an information channel (e.g. Kinase A → Kinase B), and an output (gene expression), incorporating stochastic noise at each step to model uncertainty.
This toy system will allow me to quantify information transmission in bits using mutual information and explore how the pathway’s channel capacity depends on noise
and structure. I will also investigate how modifications – such as introducing feedback loops – affect information fidelity and memory within the system.
Through this approach, I hope to better understand how molecular systems encode and manipulate information, offering insight into how chemical
matter can support the emergence of computation and life-like behaviour.
